				<h3>The start....</h3>
				<p class="timeline-item-details">
					This website was my first challenge during my associates degree, the
					idea was to create an online menu and ordering system.

					<br />

					The challenge was to create a website that would be responsive and
					that would be easy to use on a mobile device. I had to use HTML, CSS,
					no javascript was allowed for this first version. I had to be creative
					on the animations so the user would have a good experience. It was
					definitely a challenge but I'm very happy with the result.

				<h3>First time using javascript</h3>
				<p class="timeline-item-details">
					Javascript and it's glory... some people hate it, some people love it.
					I was amazed by it, the ability to overpower the my html and add some
					cool features to my website was amazing. <br />
					This project was one of my biggest challenges so far during my
					associates degree, not only I had to learn javascript but I also had
					to create create things I never did before. <br />

					The idea was to create a website where photographers could share their
					work and people could see it as a gallery....<br />
					Well that was the first though, but as we all know, things change and
					the project evolved into something else. <br />
					<br />
					So the idea now is to also create a modal to display the images or
					videos "fullscreen".... complicated but doable. <br /><br />
					What's next?

				<h3>Search bars.....</h3>

				<p class="timeline-item-details">
					Search bars are everywhere, and they are very useful. <br />
					<br />
					For this project I had to create a search bar that would filter the
					recipes based on the ingredients. <br />
					<br />
					For this project I had to use javascript, I had to create a function
					that would filter the recipes based on the ingredients. <br />
					Of course I could not use something simple... for this project I ended
					up learning Data structures and Algorithms. <br />
					I only have one work for this project.... WOW. <br />
					How complicated can you make a simple filter? Well... very complicated
					if you want to use Trie data structure. <br />
					Trie it out for yourself...

				<h3>Things are starting to get interesting.....</h3>
				<p class="timeline-item-details">
					React? What is that? <br />
					Well this was the first time I heard about React, and I was very happy
					to learn it. Being able to create components and reuse them was
					amazing. <br />
					No more messy code, no more repeating the same code over and over and
					over again. <br />
					Amazing!!!!

				<h3>My first full-stack solution</h3>
				<p class="timeline-item-details">
					For this project I had to use everything I learned so far about react,
					it was time to put in action! This was the first time I was allowed to
					use a external library, so I went with recharts to create this awesome
					interactive charts. <br />
					I had to also create a backend to send the data to the front-end, for
					this I used node.js and express. <br />
					This was only the beginning of my full-stack journey. Now I'm ready to
					create amazing things.
